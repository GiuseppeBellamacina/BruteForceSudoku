# Brute-Force Sudoku

This is a simple brute-force sudoku solver written in Python. It is not optimized for speed, but it is easy to understand and works well for small puzzles. It is based on the backtracking algorithm.

## Usage

The solver is implemented in the `Sudoku` class. To solve a puzzle, create an instance of the class and call the `solve` method with the puzzle as a list of lists. Empty cells should be represented by `0`.
    
## Extra

Stay tuned for more features and optimizations! I'm working on a **Neural Network** to solve sudokus. It will be available soon.
